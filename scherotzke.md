First, we give an introduction to the notion of moduli stack of a differential graded category. Then we explain what shifted symplectic structures are and how they are connected to Calabi--Yau structures on dg categories. More concretely, we will show that the cotangent complex to the  moduli stack of a differential graded category A is isomorphic to the moduli stack of the "Calabi--Yau completion" of A, answering a conjecture of Keller--Yeung. This is joint work with Damien Calaque and Tristan Bozec, see [arxiv.org/abs/2006.01069](arxiv.org/abs/2006.01069).
