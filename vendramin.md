_Computational algebra: groups, rings and combinatorics_. We present the computer algebra system GAP and use it to solve some research-level problems in algebra and combinatorics. The topics to investigate are groups, certain finite rings and some combinatorial structures associated with the Yang-Baxter equation (with applications in knot theory).  GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra with emphasis on computational group theory. Lecture notes available [here](https://github.com/vendramin/gap). This mini-course will be delivered together with Victoria Lebed.
